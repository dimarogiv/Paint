Steps to reproduce:
   1. start the app
   2. enable a painting mode
   3. start moving the pointer drawing some angles

Current behaviour:
   1. The created angles are showing not correctly, andgles are cutted in pixels.
   2. With moving the pointer sometimes is disappearing.
   3. The line is going to another, not expected line.

Expected behaviour:  
   The created angles should be squared, moving pointer should be always showed.

In plans:  
   Make a pointer with a different colour to make it distinguishable from the
   painted lines.
